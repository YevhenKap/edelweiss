# ðŸŽˆ Test frameworks currently only start support native ES modules. 

In future there may be more tests with other frameworks (I prefer Jest. It is well supported, but can not handle *.mjs files yet ðŸ˜¢).

Framework is designed for browser environment (In future it may be rewrite to support SSR, but it is not task yet).
